Shareholder Statements
======================

das-aktienregister.ch features an auto-generated statement for shareholders of
companies that subscribed to an appropiate plan
(which has the 'shareholder_statements' feature enabled)

Statements will be sent to shareholder via email. The shareholder (user) can
also download the pdf file with a single-auth url provided in the email.
If the shareholder does not open the email in time (see Settings_), a physical
letter will be sent (if address provided) via a service (Pingen_)

Company operators can view statement reports in the frontend (submenu entry).

Shareholder users can view all their statements in the frontend as well
(but they don't have a login yet).

Pingen
------

Letters to shareholders (who did not open the email in time) will be sent via
https://pingen.com (obviously, an API Token is required).

A simple wrapper for the API was implemented, that (for now) only supports
document upload.

:python:`None`

   set this in local settings

   **NOTE:** set this to `'test' not in sys.argv and '<TOKEN>' or ''`

:python:`PINGEN_SEND_ON_UPLOAD`
:python:`False`

   should the letter be immediately sent after upload
   (careful here when testing!)

:python:`PINGEN_SEND_COLOR`
:python:`2`

   0 = black/white, 1 = Color, 2 = Mixed (optimized)

:python:`PINGEN_API_URL`
:python:`'https://api.pingen.com'`

   api endpoint url

   **NOTE:** can't upload to stage api!

see pingen/conf.py for more options
